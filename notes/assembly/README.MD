# Introduction to Assembly Language
In this unit we will explore just what we need to know about assembly language to be able to compile miniJava.
We will focus on X86-64, though the concepts are similar for almost all processors.

Our main reference source for this unit will be the following open source book

[X86-64 Assembly Language Programming with Ubuntu](http://www.egr.unlv.edu/~ed/assembly64.pdf)

* [Overview of Computer Architecture](./architecture.md)
* [X86-64 Architecture](./archx86.md)
* [X86-64 Instructions](./instructions.md)
* [X86-64 Frame Layout and Function Calling Protocol](./frames.md)
